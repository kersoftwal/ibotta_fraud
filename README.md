# Ibotta Fouthbrain Partner Project

The Ibotta Fourthbrain Partner Project relies on working with the Berka Dataset, which is a financial dataset containing anonymized information about clients of a Czech bank, accounts, transactions and related information. 

## The objective

One of the issues about banking services involves loans, because a bank doesn't want to lend money to clients that won't be able to pay back the loan, hence the bank wants to avoid such situations by issuing loans only to 'good clients'. In order to accomplish this, we will be trying to design and develop a model to understand whether a client is a good or bad one according to their information and behaviour inside the very same bank, stored as available data into the Berka Dataset.
